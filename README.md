# hello-world
my first
Just an old fart struggling software. successfully did a 2 door python garage controller ..wasn't happy so by trial and error tried a node.js. really liked it's fast feed back. just came accross pimatic and would like to try something simple in it but after loading it and getting it running I can't figure out how to do the most simple  thing   ...like blink a led. came across this while looking and thought i'd give it a try.
